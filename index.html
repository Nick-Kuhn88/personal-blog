              One of my favorite modules within my Coding Bootcamp with the University of
              Arizona was the one where we started building this very site with
              the goal being to learn our way around GitHub.
            </p>
            <p>
              Knowing that so many apps are created in a collaborative environment,
              getting a good grasp on how a commonly used tool like GitHub works
              was just great! I also work off of two computers frequently so fully
              understanding how to create branches and pull them in to the project
              has been immensly helpful. Visit my contact page and reach out to
              collaborate on a project! We can use GitHub, obviously.

              My name is Nicholas Kuhn, and I am a recent graduate of the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp.
              I am so excited about my new endeavor as a developer!
              I hope to create imaginitve and helpful things that help people everywhere!
            </p>
            <p>
              This blog/portfolio site was created to showcase my work as a Web Developer.
              Some of the projects shown within are ones built during the coding bootcamp, and others
              are personal projects. In the contact tab you'll find links to my email
              and GitHub page, as well as links to social media accounts.
              Let's work together!
